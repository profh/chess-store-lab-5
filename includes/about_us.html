<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>We are a small, independent chess store operating solely online. We don't support our products in any, and we don't have a warranty of any kind. We paid a high school student to make our website (under the table), because we couldn't afford a real programmer. (<em>Thank God that he at least used Ruby on Rails, version 3.0.10, to build it.</em>) Subsequently, there are a few problems with our website...</p>

<p>We really hate our logo. It's <strong>so</strong> freaking ugly, but we just don't have the time to go around fixing it, just like we don't have time to fix all the security holes in this site...</p>

<p>
  Sincerely,<br />
  The Chess Store Staff
